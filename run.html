                On September 21st, 2025 I participated in the Illinois Homecoming Run. 
                I initially planned on jogging the race for fun, however, the race atmosphere made me change my mind.
                Despite starting near the back of the shoot; I quickly caught up to the front of the pack and started to compete for placements.
                During this race I passed over 200 people and didn't get passed by a single person which was quite surprising. 
                Ultimately, I finished 3rd place with a time of 17:53. 
                I'm extremely proud with how this race went considering my pre-race mindset and subpar start position.

                        July 31st 2025. A day I dreaded due to my spotty at best summer training. The first summer of full-time employment
                        greatly hindered my consistency. I averaged around 30 miles a week and didn't do a single workout. Consequently, I went into 
                        the 2025 alumni race with limited expectations. The race was 18 minutes and 22 seconds of pain. At times I felt like
                        I was running at 9 minute pace in a pair of spikes from the 1970s. The O'brian hill and ankle breaker sections 
                        (if you know you know) nearly killed me. Although I struggled, I still finished at a respectable time of 18:22 for 3 miles.
                        Big shoutout to my boy Mitch for running the race in a cow costume.

                On April 26th I completed my first marathon! The Christie Clinic Marathon is an excellent course and experience for beginners.
                The pre-race energy and near ideal weather conditions motivated me to push myself to new limits. 
                I ran the first 13.1 miles conservatively; I averaged just over 8 minutes per mile. 
                The second I hit the halfway point I realized my legs felt great. Thus, I decided to push the pace and see how many people I could catch.
                This surge resulted in a couple sub 7 miles and heaps of cocky confidence forming in my head. I genuinely believed that I would cruise to the 
                end and continue to pass the field. These pipe dreams came to an end when I hit mile 21. In my opinion this is the most brutal part of the course.
                It is a dreadful straight shot into a boring part of Savoy that made me question my life choices. I went from being invinsible to hitting the wall
                and struggling to jog 10 minute pace. Nontheless, I rallied during mile 25 and 26. I finished with a time of 
                3:24:27, not too shabby for a first marathon.

                You are going to have to take my word that Major Milk is my running alter-ego. 
                Anyone familiar with the Grove Express course knows the 400 meter hill of doom at the very start of the race.
                It is tradition for the best friends to race up the hill and then start walking. I won the first 200 meters
                but then sadly faded back and watched Shane win the yearly battle. The rest of the race consisted of shenanigans,
                bacon munching, and jello shots.

                        Another year another W for the alumni. The class of 2023 showed up to O'Brian Park and 
                        dominated the competition. I ran a surprisingly quick time of 17:27 and had a blast doing it.
                        The domination continued into ultimate frisbee as it was no contest per usual. The boys 
                        took care of business.

                My first race of 2024 and my first race after retiring from cross country and track. Originally I planned
                to jog the race and enjoy the Chicago atmosphere. However, when the race day atmosphere kicked in, I
                decided to give it my best shot and pack up with a group. I felt great during the race and loved to see
                thousands of runners braving the cold and having a good time. Ultimately I finished with a respectable time 
                of 32:01. Nowhere near a PR but the experience of racing without any pressure felt amazing.
