        I'm glad you asked! GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems, 
        it is a discipline of geography. GIS manages, visualizes, and organizes
        geospatial data (data with longitude and latitude). There are two primary data types
        associated with GIS:
        vector and raster. The former consists of lines, points, and polygons. Raster data is 
        pixelated, think of weather and NDVI maps.

        I created this map by downloading landsat (satellite) data from the US Geological Survey. 
        It showcases the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI is a metric that 
        describes vegetation health based on a plants ability to absorb red light and reflect infrared light.
        In ArcGIS Pro, I utilized the Raster Calculator tool to create a new NDVI layer with the equation:
        ("Infared" - "Red") / ("Infared" + "Red"). This equation will produce a result from -1 to 1 for a specific area. Finally
        I created a new layout and highlighted an area with high vegetative health/NDVI value. Asheville in comparison
        has weaker vegatative health. As a reminder this is raster data!

        In this interactive map I created a feature layer in ArcGIS Online for statues at Meadowbrook Park in Urbana Illinois. 
        I then collected data with ArcGIS Field Maps. Feel free to click on each point, they include information about 
        statue type, rating, and a picture (some with me).  The process of this map proved to be incredibly useful because 
        my summer 2025 internship at Roselle Public Works involved a lot of ArcGIS Field Maps work.

        Fun Fact: I collected the data while on a medium long run in the rain! The Meadowbrook Park loop ended up being 8 miles long. 
        Sadly I did not get extra credit for this effort.

        I will admit when I first created this map I felt like a real cartographer. The metadata at the 
        bottom, legend, blending, and beautiful colors meant some serious business. I enjoy how GIS projects often
        combines technical and design philosphies. If a map's design choices convolute the message the data is attempting to portray,
        the map fails. It is vital to determine an audience for a map and tailor the design for that specific audience.

    What good is data if you can't put it into one cool dashboard? In this project I downloaded vehicle theft data from 
    the Chicago Police Department Portal. I used ModelBuilder (see below) to calculate count, rate, hotspots, confidence intervals, and percent change from 2019 to 2023
    for each Chicago neighborhood. The charts react to the current view of the map. For example, if you zoom into Logan Square, it'll only show Logan Square data. 
    Furthermore, the user can select 
    a specific layer (count, percent change, rate) and analyze trends throughout the city. During this project
    I learned about the strength and annoyances of the ArcGIS ModelBuilder. I also learned that saving your work frequently
    is important because sometimes ArcGIS Pro crashes out of nowhere, boom, 3 hours of work tragically gone!

    <h3>
        ModelBuilder
    </h3>

    <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%">
        ArcGIS ModelBuilder is akin to the cool coding games you may have played in elementary. It is a visual way to 
        run and reuse code. Typically a model you create is chained together like a snake. In this example I used summarize within
        to combine Chicago neighborhoods and census tracts into one augmented layer. Calculate fields is a valuable method to
        obtain statistical metrics with geospatial data. Learning how to utilize ModelBuilder is crucial
        to master spatial analysis in ArcGIS Pro. In addition Python and R are helpful to know for GIS work/scripting.

        A Quick Note About Projections

    <p>
        I'll tell you whats wrong! Greenland is NOT larger than Africa! In fact, 
        Greenland can fit into Africa 14 times! The reason why Greenland looks funky in this map is the projection I selected.
        A projection is the process of turning our 3D earth into a 2D plane. There is no such thing as a 
        "perfect projection". Each has their own flaws, the cartographer should select the best projection possible in accordance with 
        their primary message and audience. A lot of maps in our schools use the mercator projection.
        The mercator was created in the 19th century and emphasizes western nations over others (colonization). This gives many people
        the impression that west is larger and more significant than Africa, South America, and Asia. 
        If you are making a map, research the best projection to use!!!!!

        ArcGIS Enterprise (WIP)
    </h2>

    <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;">
        ArcGIS Enterprise is a service that allows for secure management and sharing of geospatial data within an organization.
        During my fall 2025 semester I took a Enterprise class which involved a lot of moving and publishing data. In order to work in an enterprise 
        server, it is crucial to have a grasp of basic computer networking fundamentals to avoid breaches. Imagine what would happen if your company's map with confidential data 
        about clients gets leaked!
        In this class I enjoyed working with relational databases and using SQL/PostGIS to extract specific geospatial information.  
        I plan to take additional database classes to build upon my foundation I've established over the last year.
        The image below is an example of some of the queries I ran in class!
